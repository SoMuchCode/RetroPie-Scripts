TODO:
Fix problem if config uses sleep - current kludge is to insert && after it.
	-test that 'sleep..' has a command after it or it will cause problems when we put the && after it...
	-or fix it and remove: | sed "s|sleep..|sleep 1 \&\&|g"
Portablity 	-remove references to ~ and replace with $HOME
I don't like that a user has to copy the config file or modify the rc.local file: 
	-Manipulate rc.local better to extract original user joystick config
	-Write good install/uninstall scripts (that make use of above rc.local parsing / modifying)
Joystick 1 - 2 swap - it works, but doesn't always have the effect I want... Work on this, maybe do something at the hardware level? (low priority)
use lsusb to id joysticks??? Then we can assign them to controller port???

make a mode that uses xpad unless there is a custom controller setup...

make it so we don't kill xboxdrv in runcommand-onstart.sh if we are going to use the deault config :D
	create a .txt file somewhere so we know that we don't have to restart drivers after game end

PROBABLY DONE:
20171024	Portablity 	-remove hardcoded directories!!!
						-rename and move to 'joyhelp'
